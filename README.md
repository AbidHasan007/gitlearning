# Learing git it is awesome

### **First day learning history**

**06/12/2023**
Today I learned how to make a git repo and how to insert local file to github.com using git.
First of all I created a folder in my local envoirment as like as github repository so I can find them easily 
then I created a Readme file and  setup global access for my github account using my github email and user name.
After all I did these action via command line
1. git init
2. echo "Learnig git it is awesome" >> README.md
3. git add .
4. git commit -m "First commit of learning"
5. git branch -M main
6. git remote add origin https://github.com/AbidHasan007/gitlearning.git
7. git push -u origin main
Then I created a new html file named as index.html in my local envoirment and uploaded it again at github using three command add . , commit and push
